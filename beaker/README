Beaker scripts and tricks - using the bkr command line api. 

How to use these utils: 

0) remove machines.txt and all mrg*xml files 

1) Run the "scan" script, which creates machines.txt

2) Edit machines.txt (remove machines you dont want) 

3) Run the "commision.." script, which creates xml files for each job

4) run "bkr job-sumbit a.xml b.xml ..." for each xml file in your local directory. 

- Get machine meta data for mrg instances (can be customized to any group)

- TODO commision 4 nodes from mrg, run ssh into them, and set add the usr/bin/extend
