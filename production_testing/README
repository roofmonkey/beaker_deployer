Two shell scripts:

1) Edit the variables at the top.

2) Run the ifconfig.sh script - it will parse ips out of ifconfig and setup 
ssh into the corresponding machines from the machine you are starting from.

For example, run this from your namenode hadoop server, and make the variable names
all equal to the url for the data nodes, so that namenode can ssh into datanodes and start daemons, etc..
